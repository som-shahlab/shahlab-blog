[We are a group](https://shahlab.stanford.edu/doku.php?id=lab_members) of about 12 doctors, engineers, informatics professionals, and students focused on enabling better care using existing health data. We develop novel methods to learn from patient-level health data, answer clinical questions that enable better medical decisions at the point of care, and have an active effort to research safe, ethical, and cost-effective strategies for using predictive models to guide mitigating care actions. Our research group is part of the Department of Medicine at Stanford, the Clinical Excellence Research Center, and the Department of Biomedical Data Science.

We analyze multiple types of health data (EHR, Claims, Wearables, Weblogs, and Patient blogs), in service of the learning health system ([see examples](examples_of_prior_work)). The work can be grouped into three focus areas:

- We **develop methods** to analyze multiple datatypes for generating insights such as detecting skin adverse reactions by analyzing content in a [health social network](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2673831), enabling [medical device surveillance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31583282/), discovering drug adverse events [from clinical notes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23571773) using novel methods for [processing textual documents](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/agile-nlp-clinical-text-covid-19-and-beyond).
- We **answer clinical questions** using aggregate patient data at the [bedside](http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2016winter/on-the-button.html). The [green button project](greenbutton) established the viability of this idea and led to the creation of [Atropos Health](https://www.atroposhealth.com/).
- We **build predictive models** that allow taking mitigating actions, [keeping the human in the loop](https://stanmed.stanford.edu/artificial-intelligence-puts-humanity-health-care/). Research on [foundation models](rail) from our team is put into practice by the [Data Science team at SHC](https://dsatshc.stanford.edu/).
